range brothers
Kendrick Lamar, Baby Keem
Bad bitch, pardon me, I say "What's up?"
Educated, so I put her in the cut
I need a girlfriend, I need a girlfriend
Two hoes and I think I did too much
I got two phones and I don't know who to trust
I need a girlfriend, I need a girlfriend
Bet that girlfriend lonely, introduce her to my humor
It's a lot of bitches that they sent home in their Uber
Uh, high-profile niggas in my circle dodgin' rumors
I been tucked away dodgin' blood suckin' maneuvers
Huh? Okay, just say you not ready
Okay, okay, comin’ in heavy
Okay, they ain't in shape, I'm petty, okay, okay
Okay, y'all be on E, un-leady
Okay, okay, hold the confetti
Okay, okay, just say you not ready
They wanna bite the hand that try to feed 'em, prudes
You cannot hide behind the shades, I see right through it
You ain't stand up on your word, then you's a fool
They're not, chea, they're not, chea, they're not bool
be wanna see me whole gang on TV, PG my Rollie
Turnin' down tops and the top bitches, that remind me of the old days
Sneakin' in hoes with the backstage pass
What they all in, huh, for the poet? Huh?
'm a young poetic nigga, I just go at it, nigga
'm a whore at it, nigga
You could ask my mama, we poetic, nigga
was raised in the projects, we could go at it, nigga
can't wait no time on a co-edded, nigga
Bro-code, me and Dave count through seven figures
Raised around bottles and dope fiends
On a high seat since the day I turned sixteen
7-47, I'm starin' at plane wings
Prayin' the Lord's seen, Grandma prayin' for me (ayy)
